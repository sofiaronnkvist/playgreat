# Code Review

1. `example.js:10-15` - Remember to think about X and this could be refactored using the amazing Y function.
2. `index.js 103` - Use Pixi's Ticker instead app.ticker.add(gameLoop)
3. `index.js 64` - Why isn't the animte function ran in the gameLoop?
4. `setIntervals 109 & 116` - You can remove these and instead remove a needle everytime its Y value is less than the fabrics, this would happen in the 'gameLoop' function ðŸ™‚
5. `index.js 205` - You can use event.key === "ArrowLeft" instead of the keys code.
6. `index.js` Everything is put in a single file. The code would be easier to read if it was divided up into different files. 
7. `index.html 25` PIXI JS is hotlinked as a script instead of being imported as a node module.
8. `index.js 46` A lot of code is repeated twice. For example left hand and right hand could instead be a single class that you just switch out the image of.
9. `index.js 70` It is super clever to use Math.Sin(delta) To make the movement speed up and down like a sewing machine!
10. `index.js` Very good variable names and function names. 
11. Lovely illustrations! Great work and was it was fun to play. ðŸ˜Š
